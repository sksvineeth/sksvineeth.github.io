  <p> I’m a Principal Machine Learning Engineer at Schneider Electric, where I lead AI initiatives across deep learning, MLOps, and reinforcement learning, with applications in export control, risk taxonomy, and enterprise-scale anomaly detection. 

My work bridges systems engineering and applied machine learning, emphasizing scalable architectures and production-grade deployment. Outside of 9-5, my research focuses on interpretable and uncertainty-aware models, evidential deep learning, and the development of bias-aware systems that align with principles of fairness, robustness, and social accountability.
